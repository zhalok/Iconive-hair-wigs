            All stock orders are processed within 24-48 hours of receiving
            payment, and are shipped out as soon as possible. However, If the
            product is not in stock or a customer places a custom order, it
            might take 10-30 days to manufacture as these items are mostly
            hand-crafted.

            After the product is manufactured/ is ready to be shipped, we send
            real pictures or videos of that product to the following customer if
            he asks for it. After buyerâ€™s confirmation, we will send the product
            to FedEx warehouses for delivery. After handing over the package to
            FedEx for the delivery, we will get a tracking code which we will
            send to our customer for his/her convenience. With this code,
            customers can easily find out the product's location & whereabouts.

            Standard shipping usually takes between 5-12 business days to arrive
            as per FedEx delivery system. Please note that shipping times may
            vary depending on your location and shipping method. Any issue
            regarding product shipping is not our concern as this responsibility
            then transfers to FedEx. So any issue regarding product shipment
            after we handover the product to FedEx is not our responsibility to
            solve, therefore not on us.
